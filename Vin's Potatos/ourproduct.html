          They're rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a
          life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented
          scurvy. Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an
          electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and
          nervous system.

          Russet potatoes are also a good source of minerals, with each medium
          potato providing 1.9 milligrams of iron, or 10 percent of the DV; 52
          milligrams of magnesium, or 13 percent of the DV; 123 milligrams of
          phosphorus, or 12 percent of the DV; 0.6 milligrams of zinc, or 4
          percent of the DV; and 31 milligrams of calcium, ...

          Red Desiree Potatoes are part of the Red Potato family and are
          considered to be the healthiest of all potatoes, as they contain the
          highest levels of vitamins, minerals and healthy phytochemicals.

          Like most types of potatoes, yellow are an excellent source of
          energy-boosting carbohydrates, vitamin C, and potassium, but are also
          a good source of vitamin B6, thiamin, and dietary fiber

          "Fresh veggies often taste the best, especially if the vegetable is in
          season. But the good news is that the nutritional value of a vegetable
          isn't reduced during either the canning or freezing process â€” making
          canned or frozen veggies just as healthy as fresh ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          These include vitamin K, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and
          calcium, in addition to copper, iron, zinc, vitamins A and C, and B
          vitamins, according to the Plants review. These nutrients are known to
          work in synergy to promote bone mass and bone strength.

        <p>
          Similar to canned veggies, frozen veggies are low cost and quite
          stable. What's more is that the freezing process is very favorable
          toward vegetables, with nutrients, vitamins and minerals all being
          well-retained. In fact, frozen veggies may actually be more nutritious
          than fresh ones, in some cases.

        <p>
          In general, the differences in nutritional value between fresh and
          frozen vegetables are so minor that they would unlikely impact your
          overall health. When shopping for frozen vegetables, keep an eye out
          for added sugar, salt, and sauces.

        <p>
          Nutritionally speaking, instant mashed potatoes offer roughly the same
          vitamins and minerals as the real mashed potatoes with the exception
          of Vitamin C. To please palates, they tend to be higher in sodium,
          significantly higher than the amount of salt home cooks would add when
          making them at home from scratch
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./Images/imagess.jpg" alt="Chips" />
        <p>
          The practical side of dehydrating potatoes is that you can almost make
          a meal out of potatoes so to have them on hand to cook up at a moments
          notice is super convenient. Dehydrated potatoes also make a great
          addition to your food storage as they will last for years if stored
          properly.

        <p>
          Processed potatoes (such as dehydrated and frozen potatoes) deliver
          the same nutrients as fresh potatoes, (such as potassium, vitamin C
          and fiber), but the amounts will vary depending on the potato form.
          Preparation methods have variable effects on potato nutrient content.
